The indexing and operations supported by *frame* `dataset` objects are similar
to those supported by `data.frame` objects, but there are a few extensions and
differences.

We will illustrate the indexing operations with a sample dataset with two key
columns:

```{r}
library(frame)
x <- cbind.dataset(name = rownames(mtcars), mtcars)
keys(x) <- dataset(k1 = rep(LETTERS[1:4], 8),
                   k2 = rep(1:8, each = 4))
print(x)
```
